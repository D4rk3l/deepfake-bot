Hosted Deployments
==================
This feature is not yet implemented and I will do only this if I get enough support. The idea is that for patrons, you just PM the bot with:

``df!deploy hosted <@user> <token>``

Then I would take care of the rest. You would still need to adminster your bot's account, name it, and add its avatar image. But there would be 
no need to fiddle around with Github or Heroku in that case.
